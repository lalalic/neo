# Update listing

Status: `working` — browser-harness runner implemented; live account verification pending.

Preconditions: an explicit item and exact listing fields to change.

Open the item, edit only the approved Market Package fields with
`browser-harness`, and verify the saved values in the publisher console.
Supported field groups are:

- title, short/long description, release notes, public/support URLs, and
  reviewer test instructions;
- screenshots, promotional/feature graphics (posters), and demo/preview video;
- privacy practices, data-use declarations, distribution/payment designation;
- permissions and host-permission justifications.

Listing metadata changes are external side effects and must not be inferred
from navigation success.
